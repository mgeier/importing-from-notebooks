Importing Local Python Modules from Jupyter Notebooks
=====================================================

This repository contains a few Jupyter notebooks which show how it is possible
to import local Python modules, even if they are located in sub-directories.

[View it on nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mgeier/importing-from-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb)

If you re-use local modules a lot, you should consider turning them into proper
Python packages which can be installed with Python's package manager `pip`.

If you know other (reasonable) methods to use local modules, please create an
issue or a pull request!
