Importing local Python modules from Jupyter notebooks
=====================================================

This repository contains a few Jupyter notebooks which show how it is possible
to import local Python modules, even if they are located in sub-directories.

If you re-use local modules a lot, you should consider turning them into proper
Python packages which can be installed with Python's package manager `pip`.

If you know other (reasonable) methods to use local modules, please create an
issue or a pull request!
